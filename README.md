What is the glaring difference between Peloton's $13/month app & their $528/yr Connected Fitness? Resistance Levels.

Resistance levels allow you to follow workouts.
Resistance levels keep you honest when you feel like quitting.
Resistance levels allow for riding modes like Lanebreak.
Resistance levels let you achieve Personal Records and see your growth.
